# Rock Paper Scissors Game

This is a Python-based Rock Paper Scissors game with a graphical user interface (GUI) built using **Tkinter** and sound effects managed through **Pygame**. The game allows users to play against the computer, with sound effects triggered for each outcome (win, lose, or tie).

## Features

- Simple and interactive GUI using **Tkinter**.
- Sound effects for win, lose, and tie outcomes using **Pygame**.
- Keeps track of the score throughout the game.
- Option to reset the game to start a new round.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure that Python is installed on your system. You can download Python from the official website: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

You will also need to install the following libraries:
- **Tkinter**: For the graphical user interface (GUI).
- **Pygame**: For the sound effects.

To install these libraries, run the following commands in your terminal/command prompt:

```bash
pip install pygame
```

**Tkinter** comes bundled with Python, so no separate installation is needed for that.

### Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/harshvardhansv5/Rock-Paper-Scissors-Game.git
cd Rock-Paper-Scissors-Game
```

### Sound Files

Make sure you have the following sound files in a directory named `sounds/`:
- `win.wav`: Sound played when the user wins.
- `lose.wav`: Sound played when the user loses.
- `tie.wav`: Sound played when thereâ€™s a tie.

You can place these sound files in a folder called `sounds` inside the project directory.

## Usage

To run the game, execute the following command:

```bash
python Rock-Paper-Scissor.py
```

The game will open a window with buttons for Rock, Paper, and Scissors. Click any button to play a round. The game will display the result (win, lose, or tie) along with the updated score. You can reset the game using the "Reset Game" button.

## Files

- `python Rock-Paper-Scissor.py`: The main Python file containing the game logic.
- `sounds/`: A directory containing the sound files used in the game (e.g., `win.wav`, `lose.wav`, `tie.wav`).
- `README.md`: This file.
